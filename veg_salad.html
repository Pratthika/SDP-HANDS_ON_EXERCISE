    <h2 id="benefits">Benefits of Vegetable</h2>


    <p id="benefitsParagraph">Lettuce, spinach, and other salad greens are an important part of a healthful diet because they can be year-round sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, and other nutrients. Red and dark green leafy vegetables are generally higher in antioxidants, Vitamin B6, and other nutrients than lighter colored greens. It is important to store leafy greens at refrigerator temperatures and rinse well under running water before using. To reduce the risk of foodborne illness, observe “Use by” dates printed on bagged leafy vegetables and salad mixes and use within two days after opening. There are many flavorful and nutritious leafy greens available to consumers, especially if you choose to grow them from seed.</p>
